# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Search engines read it as what it is.** A title and description in the words players
  search with, one per view; one h1 per view; a sitemap of the five views, named in
  robots.txt; the app described as a free `WebApplication` in JSON-LD. Pinned by
  `e2e/seo.spec.ts`.
- **A Ludven app.** The footer names the studio, and links its app, support and privacy
  pages once `FACTORY_BOARD_STUDIO_URL` is set. The packages' author is Ludven.
- `FACTORY_BOARD_UMAMI_HOST` moves the visit counter, and the CSP with it (ADR 37's
  addendum).
- **Fix these first.** The Overview opens with up to three problems, one per cause, each
  with what the save shows and what to try: the next carrier tier of the same kind, the
  line that makes a missing ingredient, the box already holding it, or the megawatts a
  grid is short. The bottleneck list shows the same fix per line.
- **Copy for Reddit / Discord**: the same problems as Markdown, session name only on request,
  with a select-and-copy fallback when the clipboard is refused.
- On the demo, a card with the saves folder and a copy button.
- The hosted copy at [factory-board.ludven.com](https://factory-board.ludven.com) (moved from
  factory-board.gapchix.io on 2026-10-05, which now redirects there; the repository moved to
  `ludvenhq/factory-board`): a real
  recipe book baked from outside the repository
  ([ADR 38](docs/adr/0038-the-hosted-copy-ships-a-recipe-book.md)), an anonymous visit
  counter ([ADR 37](docs/adr/0037-the-hosted-copy-counts-visits.md)), a CSP that allows
  nothing else, and `deploy/` to build and serve it.

- **Bring your own recipe book.** A `Docs/en-US.json` dropped on the page is extracted in a
  Web Worker by the same code as the CLI, validated, remembered in IndexedDB and read by
  every view; the header names the book in a `Recipes` chip with _Load yours_ / _Forget_,
  and the banner counts the lines a save runs that the book does not know
  ([ADR 34](docs/adr/0034-the-recipe-book-can-arrive-at-runtime.md)).
- `@factory-board/game-data/browser` — the extraction half of the package without
  `node:fs`; `decodeDocs` sniffs the byte-order mark and reads UTF-16LE or UTF-8.
- Space Elevator quotas for Phases 3, 4 and 5, scaled by the save's cost multiplier
  (`phase.costMultiplier`, from the game state's `mSpacePartsCostMultiplier`), and
  withdrawn when a save has delivered past them
  ([ADR 35](docs/adr/0035-the-quotas-are-transcribed-then-checked.md)).
- `snapshot.modded`, from the save header, shown on the session chip and in the coverage
  notice.
- Error boundaries for the page and the layout, with a prefilled GitHub issue link that
  never includes the save ([ADR 36](docs/adr/0036-the-board-meets-a-strangers-save.md)).
- Drops take several files: a recipe book first, then every save, the newest becoming the
  board and the rest the history. The header picker accepts `.sav,.json`, several at once.
- A favicon, an Apple icon and a preview card generated at build, `metadataBase` with
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, `robots.txt`, and a footer with the version, licence and source.
- Playwright smoke suite on the built export, run in CI after the build; `E2E_SAVE` and
  `E2E_OLD_SAVE` exercise a real save and a too-old one locally.
- `scripts/check-saves.mjs` — every save in a folder through the reader, as a table.
- `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` with `rules-of-hooks` and `exhaustive-deps`.

- `@factory-board/planner` — production solver with machine counts, power, raw inputs,
  production balance and structured warnings.
- `@factory-board/game-data` — `Docs.json` extractor, Zod-validated database and the
  `factory-board-extract` CLI with Steam and Epic auto-detection.
- `@factory-board/save-reader` — save-file reducer producing a `WorldSnapshot` with
  per-line uptime, clock, building census, milestones and Space Elevator progress.
- Integration test pinning Space Elevator Phase 2 to 44 machines and 344 MW against a real
  extracted database.
- Project documentation: spec, architecture, roadmap and seven ADRs.

- Web app: Overview, Planner and Progression views with hand-built bar and meter
  charts, validated for contrast in both themes.
- Default save auto-loading via `SATISFACTORY_SAVE` / `SATISFACTORY_SAVES_DIR`, plus a
  dev-time watcher that re-reads the save on every autosave.

- `@factory-board/layout` — zone clustering over building coordinates, and layered
  layout for the production graph. Pure, dependency-free, 26 tests.
- Building placements in `WorldSnapshot`, positioned in metres.
- **Base view** — a top-down map of the base with machines coloured by uptime, and
  per-zone machines, power, uptime and output.
- **Flow diagram** on the Planner: the plan drawn as a layered DAG with throughput-
  weighted edges.

- Belt, pipe and power-line routes in `WorldSnapshot`, transformed from the splines and
  wire endpoints in the save into world-space polylines.

- **The base map pans and zooms.** Drag, scroll, arrow keys, or the toolbar. It redraws
  at the current view rather than magnifying, so type stays the size it says, marks drawn
  as one split apart once there is room, and labels dropped for want of space come back
  ([ADR 9](docs/adr/0009-the-map-redraws-at-the-view.md)).
- **Belt direction chevrons.** A conveyor's spline is stored in build order, which runs
  input to output — verified against miners, the one building that can only be a source.
  Pipes get none: fluid direction depends on the pumps.
- **Focus a zone** by clicking it on the map or its card underneath. The two stay in
  step, the rest of the base dims, and the view flies to it.
- `frameContent` and `sampleAlong` in `@factory-board/layout` — choosing what a map should
  frame, and spacing markers along a polyline. 22 more tests.
- `route.arrow` theme token, so chevrons keep contrast against the belt in both themes.
- `npm run typecheck` now covers `apps/web` as well, where the extracted game database is
  present. It skips itself in CI, which has no database, exactly as the integration tests
  do.
- Display names for every placeable building, so maps name "The HUB" and "Miner Mk.1"
  rather than `TradingPost` and `MinerMk1`.
- `groupNearby` in the layout package: reusable single-linkage grouping.

- **A survey grid** under the base map, on round world coordinates, so the ground between
  the cells reads as somewhere rather than as nothing. The scale bar is one grid square.
- **Zones are washed with the tone of the work inside them** — the same one their card
  carries — so the map says which part of the base is struggling before a label is read.
- **Leader lines.** A label with no room beside its mark now moves out a ring or two and
  keeps a line back to what it names, instead of being dropped.

- **Power and extraction anchor zones.** A coal plant, a pump house and a mining outpost
  are places you built, and they were being reported as buildings belonging to nothing.
  Clustering runs in passes now, because letting them anchor alongside machines welds two
  factory cells into one blob ([ADR 13](docs/adr/0013-zones-are-clustered-in-passes.md)).
  On the reference save, 4 zones and a stray became 9 zones and none, with the production
  zones unchanged.
- **A save says what a miner pulls and what a generator burns.** `BuildingPlacement`
  carries what the building is for, the resource it handles, and — for the extractors and
  generators no production line covers — its own uptime. Classified from the properties a
  building carries rather than from a list of class names.
- **Zones are named for what they are for**: the product their machines mostly make, the
  resource their extractors pull, or the fuel their generators burn. "Coal Power",
  "Water", "Iron Ore".
- **Zones can be named by hand.** The name is pinned to the ground rather than to a zone
  id, so it survives the next autosave renumbering everything
  ([ADR 14](docs/adr/0014-a-zone-reference-is-a-point.md)).
- **Deep links to a zone.** `/base?zone=coal-power` focuses it on load, focusing one
  writes the link, and renaming that zone moves the link with it.
- **Plan targets are assigned to a zone**, so "build 6 more smelters" says _where_. Zone
  cards show what the plan wants built there against what is already standing, and the
  planner's line cards carry the zone they are destined for. Targets sharing a zone are
  rounded up together, because two lines in one cell share a machine.
- `AnchorPass` in `@factory-board/layout`: cluster in rounds, earlier passes first, a
  later pass's cluster joining an earlier zone it sits wholly inside. `Zone` and
  `ClusterResult` are generic over the placement type, so a caller gets its own richer
  placements back on `anchors`.
- 33 more tests, including the app's zone naming, pinning and plan-by-zone rules —
  `apps/*/src/**/*.test.ts` is part of the suite now.

- **Belts and pipes are drawn as runs, not as buildings.** `joinRuns` in
  `@factory-board/layout` joins what continues, end-to-start and never reversed: 101 belt
  objects become 59 runs on the reference save, 25 pipes become 16, and direction chevrons
  space themselves along a route rather than per segment.
- **The fittings that break a run are drawn** — splitters, mergers, lifts and containers,
  as beads in the belt's own colour, appearing with the zoom. They explain 64 of the 118
  run ends; the machines already drawn explain most of the rest
  ([ADR 15](docs/adr/0015-runs-are-joined-fittings-are-drawn.md)).
- **A hover card on the map**, carrying what a mark is, what it is made in or what it
  handles, its uptime as a bar, and the zone it stands in. It appears where the pointer
  arrived and flips to whichever side of it has room.

- **History — the session over time.** The game keeps three rotating autosave slots, so a
  quarter of an hour later the moment is gone. Every save the board sees is now written
  down as a digest — about a kilobyte against the snapshot's 40 KB — in IndexedDB, keyed
  by the session's own clock ([ADR 16](docs/adr/0016-history-keeps-a-digest.md)). The
  write happens wherever the board is, because the page nobody has open records nothing.
- **"Since the last save"** — lines that stopped, started, grew or came back, ordered by
  what you would want to be told first, with what the session gained in buildings,
  machines, power, deliveries and milestones.
- **Machines, power, uptime and buildings over the session**, as lines with a readout that
  follows the pointer to the nearest save.
- **A Space Elevator burn-down** with a straight-line estimate of what is left, measured
  within the current phase only — the counter resets when a phase is delivered, and
  measuring across that reads as going backwards. It says nothing at all until something
  has been delivered to judge a rate by.
- `TimeChart` in the chart layer, hand-built at about 140 lines.
  [ADR 6 was revisited on the evidence](docs/adr/0006-no-charting-library.md) and still
  says no library.
- `WorldSnapshot.savedAt` — the header's `saveDateTime`, sanity-checked rather than
  trusted: it has been a string, a number and Unreal's own tick count across versions of
  the format, and a misread would file a save under the year 58000.
- 13 more tests, over the digest, the diff and the burn-down.

- **A second map: the factory itself, on a WebGL canvas.** Every building drawn at its
  real size and angle, switched from the Base view, with the schematic left exactly as it
  was — the two answer different questions and neither is a better version of the other
  ([ADR 17](docs/adr/0017-a-second-map-on-a-canvas.md)). Belts carry chevrons travelling
  downstream, machines are coloured by uptime, zones are washed and named, and the zone
  selection, the `?zone=` link and the hover card are shared with the schematic.
- **Building footprints in `@factory-board/game-data`.** `mClearanceData` in the game's
  own `Docs.json` states the ground each building stands on: a Constructor is 8 × 10 m, a
  Coal-Powered Generator 10 × 26 m, a Space Elevator 15 × 43 m. The hard box is taken over
  the soft one, which is the room a player needs to stand and use the machine and would
  draw everything half again as big. 499 of 546 building classes have one.
- **`BuildingPlacement.facing`** — the yaw out of the quaternion each building was placed
  at, in degrees clockwise from north. On the reference save all four iron smelters read
  310°, which is what a row built side by side should look like.
- `pixi.js`, the app's first runtime dependency taken on for drawing, loaded only when the
  factory view is opened.
- 19 more tests, over the clearance boxes, the yaw and the rotated-rectangle maths.

- **Trace the chain.** Click a machine on the factory map and it lights everything that
  feeds it and everything it feeds, fogging the rest of the base. The panel names the
  **weakest link** — the worst-running thing upstream, how many machines back — and takes
  the camera there. It says nothing when nothing upstream is running worse, because then
  the trouble is where you clicked
  ([ADR 18](docs/adr/0018-the-save-says-what-feeds-what.md)).
- **`WorldSnapshot.links`** — what feeds what, from the connections the save records.
  Every connection is declared from both ends (422 of them on the reference save, none
  one-way), and direction comes out of the component names rather than out of geometry.
  Pipes are undirected, because which way fluid moves depends on the pumps.
- **`BuildingPath.building`** — the belt or pipe that drew each route, so a chain can
  light the exact runs it passes through.
- Clicking the ground on the factory map picks out the zone you clicked in; clicking a
  machine traces it. 12 more tests.
- **What a machine is making reads off the factory map.** Machines making the same thing
  within 30 m are one block carrying one caption — `Iron Ingot ×4` — grouped with
  `groupNearby` from `@factory-board/layout`. 7 more tests.
- **Outposts are drawn in a margin beside the base map**, the way an atlas insets an
  island it cannot fit on the plate: each in its own box at its own scale, named for its
  zone and labelled with how far away it is and in which direction —
  `190 m E · 6 bldg`. A group leaves the frame when the factory would keep less than
  three fifths of the map's longest side by including it, and never when it holds a fifth
  or more of the buildings ([ADR 20](docs/adr/0020-outposts-go-in-the-margin.md)).
  On the reference save the frame goes from 417 × 145 m to the factory's own
  151 × 145 m, and the scale from 2.53 to 5.22 units per metre. 10 more tests.

- **The database says what unlocks a recipe.** `GameDatabase` gains `schematics` — every
  schematic that hands out a recipe, with its name, kind and tech tier. The extractor kept
  the 42 numbered milestones out of `FGSchematic` and dropped the rest, which is where
  hard drives and MAM research live; it now keeps all 197 that unlock something, covering
  every one of the 291 recipes, for 37 KB on a 222 KB database
  ([ADR 30](docs/adr/0030-the-save-says-what-you-can-build.md)).
- **`unlockedRecipes` and `recipeUnlocks`** in `@factory-board/planner`: what a save's
  purchased schematics let you build, and what would unlock what they do not. A database
  with no unlock data answers `null` rather than an empty set, because "nothing is known"
  must never be drawn as "you have nothing".
- **`priceSwaps` and `priceAllSwaps`**: every recipe that could make an item, priced
  against the _whole_ plan in machines, power and each raw resource. It has to be the
  whole plan — Cast Screws removes the rod constructors that only existed to feed the
  screw constructors, so pricing the screw line alone reports a saving of nothing and
  misses five machines. 55 candidate solves take 34 ms on the reference plan.
- **"Other ways to build it"** on the Planner: every alternate ranked by what it would
  save, split into what the save has unlocked and what it has not. On the reference save
  the first half reads _"Nothing you have unlocked would improve this plan"_ and the
  second is a shopping list of seventeen hard drives, the best worth nine machines.
- **A line you cannot build says so.** The 44-machine Phase 2 plan contains six lines and
  nine machines behind two milestones the reference save has not bought, and reported them
  as ordinary work. The card now reads `NOT UNLOCKED — it needs Tier 3 · Basic Steel
Production`. The planner itself is not gated: planning ahead of your tech tree is
  deliberate, and treating a locked recipe as absent would silently turn Steel Ingot into
  a raw input.
- **The recipe dropdown carries the price and the lock** — `Alternate: Cast Screws · -5
machines · locked` — and is ordered cheapest first instead of by database order.
- **The demo has hard drives.** A Foundry and a fourth alternate, so both halves are
  visible without the game: its save has found the Cast Screws drive, which saves it a
  machine, and not the Iron Alloy Ingot drive, which would save another by spending copper
  ore. 39 more tests.

- **The database knows what a generator is.** `GameDatabase` gains `generators` — the four
  buildings that declare an output, each with its power and every fuel it takes, priced per
  minute; and items gain `energyMJ`. Every generator declares `mPowerConsumption` of zero,
  so the extractor had been dropping all of them: power was a number the factory spent and
  nothing that anything produced
  ([ADR 31](docs/adr/0031-power-is-an-input-like-ore.md)). 17 generator-and-fuel pairs and
  26 fuels, for 2.5 KB on a 225 KB database.
- **`fuelToCarry` and `generatorsToCover`** in `@factory-board/planner`: what a load costs
  per minute in fuel, water and waste, and what it would take to cover a shortfall.
  Generators throttle to what their grid draws and burn in proportion, so a bill follows
  the megawatts rather than the generators — five coal generators at 20% cost exactly what
  one at full output costs.
- **A grid that would go over says what to build there.** The Planner has told anyone
  short of power to "build generators" since grids were first read, without knowing what a
  generator is. It now names them, counts them and prices the fuel, leading with whatever
  that grid already burns: _Grid 1 is 9 MW short — 1 × Biomass Burner, 1.2 Solid
  Biofuel/min_.
- **And what feeding the whole thing costs.** A plan's inputs were the ore its machines
  eat; the power to run them was free. On the reference save the Phase 2 plan takes the
  base from 20.4 Coal/min to 48.7, from 61 m³ of water to 146, and **from 9.6 Solid
  Biofuel a minute to 19** — which nothing on that base makes, because they are carried to
  the burners by hand.
- **A generator standing empty is priced.** The Overview counted them; it now says what
  they cost — _1 generator out of fuel, 75 MW idle_ — which is the difference between a
  burner that wants a walk across the base and the reason a grid is browning out.

- **The database knows what a rate travels down and comes out of.** `GameDatabase` gains
  `carriers` — every belt, lift and pipe with what it moves a minute — and `extractors`,
  with what each pulls at a normal node. Neither figure is stated in a plan's units:
  `mSpeed` is twice the item rate and `mFlowLimit` is m³ a _second_
  ([ADR 32](docs/adr/0032-a-rate-has-to-travel.md)).
- **`carriersFor`, `extractionFrom` and `extractorsFor`** in `@factory-board/planner`: how
  many of each tier it takes to move a rate, and what a set of standing extractors can
  deliver. Extraction answers as a **range**, half to double, because node purity is
  world-generation data no save contains — a single number there would read as a
  measurement.
- **"Can it be moved and fed"** on the Planner. The plan the board writes in one click asks
  for 176 Iron Ingot/min over a Mk.1 belt that carries sixty, and 300.75 Iron Ore/min from
  two Miner Mk.1s that cannot give 240 with both nodes pure. Three of the reference save's
  seventeen lines outgrow the belt they run on, and two of its raw inputs are beyond the
  mine that exists whatever is under it.
- **What a belt carries is followed through the save's own network**, out of each machine,
  along the run and through mergers — and stops at a splitter, because how much goes each
  way depends on what the far ends take. A tier standing anywhere in the world counts as one
  you have, so the suggestions mark what you would have to unlock.
- **A backed-up line can name the belt.** "Nothing downstream is taking them" is where the
  diagnosis stopped; where a run the output cannot avoid is at or over capacity it now
  finishes the sentence — _the Conveyor Belt Mk.1 out of it carries 60/min and these
  machines make 120_.

- **The map names its landmarks.** A building said nothing unless it had a role, which left
  36 of the reference save's 79 drawn buildings anonymous — including the four largest, the
  Space Elevator (645 m²) among them, drawn as an unlabelled grey slab
  ([ADR 33](docs/adr/0033-the-map-names-its-landmarks.md)). Everything drawn is named now
  except the floor and the fittings a belt runs through.
- **A box says what is in it**, because "Storage Container" is the one thing about a box a
  reader can already see. `5,174 Iron Rod +1 more`, `1,016 Copper Ingot +1 more`. A stack of
  boxes is one place — a base stacks them, and two on the reference save stand at exactly the
  same point holding Cable and Wire.
- **`placement.holding`** in `@factory-board/save-reader`: what one container holds, kept
  alongside the base-wide total it was previously summed into.
- **The warehouse has a place.** The Overview's storage panel gains a **find the box** link
  per starving line; `/base?holding=Desc_Wire_C` flies the map to the fullest container
  holding it and rings it. _"2,029 Wire sitting in a container"_ has been the board's most
  actionable sentence since the diagnosis learned to look in the warehouse, and it has never
  said which container.
- **The Space Elevator carries its phase** in the hover card — the one thing it has to add
  beyond its name.

### Changed

- **Phase 2 is 1,000 Smart Plating, 1,000 Versatile Framework, 100 Automated Wiring**, not
  500 / 500 / 100 — the pre-1.0 numbers. The plan the board writes on the reference save
  doubles accordingly ([ADR 35](docs/adr/0035-the-quotas-are-transcribed-then-checked.md)).
- `sync-game-data.mjs` writes an envelope `{ source, database }`; the page reads which
  book was baked from it, never from `sourceBuildId`.
- Every page reads the database through `useGameData()`; the module constant is gone.
- Save failures name the file and its size, lead with the parser's own message, and are
  shown in the header as well as the drop zone, with a _Dismiss_.
- The banner and the History view no longer mention `npm`; they say where `Docs.json`
  lives on Steam, Epic and Linux, and to drop a newer autosave.
- README: status line, a "bring your own recipe book" section, and how to build a copy
  for hosting without baking your own save into it.

- **Map captions appear when there is room rather than at a fixed zoom.** Machine names
  used to be held back until 320% because four smelters in a row drew "Iron Ingot" four
  times on top of itself; named once per block, a caption needs only 22 px of block on
  screen and a space nothing has taken
  ([ADR 19](docs/adr/0019-a-name-per-block-not-per-machine.md)). Zone and block captions
  are placed against one list of what is spoken for, zones first and then blocks
  largest-first. On the reference save the whole iron chain names itself at 304% and the
  five-generator coal plant from 40%.
- Zone captions on the factory map are cased in the surface colour, like the schematic
  map's type, so a belt crossing one no longer strikes it through.
- **One arrow at the edge per outpost, carrying the name of the box it points at.**
  Pointers used to be grouped by where they landed on the edge and to state a distance of
  their own, measured to the furthest building while the margin measured to the centre —
  so the same copper wing was announced as 220 m and 190 m in one picture. Distance is
  now stated once, by the margin.
- **The base map is not rotated onto its principal axis**, and the roadmap item asking for
  it is closed. Measured over every angle: the tightest rotation is 64°, saves 13.6% of
  frame area, moves the ground actually covered from 2.5% to 2.9%, and costs north.

- **Reach in `frameContent` is bought with buildings**, not handed out flat: a group pulls
  the frame 55 m per building plus a share-weighted term for the size of the base. One
  water extractor 115 m out was widening the reference save's frame by 28%
  ([ADR 11](docs/adr/0011-reach-is-bought-with-buildings.md)). `FrameOptions.minReachM`
  is replaced by `reachPerBuildingM`.
- **The map canvas takes the shape of the base** on both axes, and its surface is cut to
  it. A base 463 m across and 1011 m deep used 30% of the canvas width in the "Everything"
  view; it is now a portrait panel that fills it
  ([ADR 12](docs/adr/0012-the-canvas-takes-the-shape-of-the-base.md)).
- Zone captions sit in a band cut out of the top of their own zone, and are drawn after
  the belts — a conveyor crossing a cell used to strike its name through.
- Belts and map type are cased in the surface colour, so crossings read as one run over
  another and a label survives whatever it crosses.
- A landmark no longer outranks a starving machine for label space. At a flat bonus a
  lookout tower took the room a cell running at 0% needed.
- Landmarks on the map carry state in their outline wherever they measure any: a coal
  generator at 67% reads amber, while the HUB and the Space Elevator stay grey.
- Zone uptime folds in extractors and generators, so a zone of fuel-starved burners can
  say so. It is worked out once, beside the zone cards, and handed to the map — the wash
  and the card can no longer disagree about it.
- The stored plan is version 2, carrying each target's zone. A v1 plan loads unchanged and
  is rewritten as v2.
- A lone machine standing inside a zone joins it instead of being counted as a stray. A
  stray is one that is alone _and_ nowhere near anything, which is the thing worth
  reporting.
- Map detail no longer comes from a native `<title>`, which took a second to appear,
  could not be styled and could not carry a bar. Marks keep the same text as an
  `aria-label`, so what a screen reader hears is unchanged.
- **One map, not two.** The SVG schematic and the Schematic/Factory toggle are gone; the
  WebGL factory map is the map of the base
  ([ADR 21](docs/adr/0021-one-map-not-two.md)). Everything built after the two maps
  shipped — tracing the chain, a name per block, true footprints — had landed on the
  factory map only, so the schematic was a view that had stopped receiving work while
  still costing a toggle and a promise to keep both drawings in agreement. About 2,100
  lines removed, including the outpost margin rail.
- A browser that cannot start WebGL now gets no map rather than the schematic, and is
  pointed at the zone cards below, which carry the same figures in text.
- **Signposts to what is off the map.** Every place entirely off screen gets a chip on
  the edge it lies beyond, carrying its name, an arrow, how far away it is in metres and
  how it is running; clicking one flies there. Worked out against the current camera
  rather than the opening frame, so it keeps telling the truth as the reader moves
  ([ADR 22](docs/adr/0022-signposts-are-worked-out-at-the-camera.md)). On the reference
  save the opening view draws two and the iron factory six, and four to an edge is the
  most it will draw before the rest become a count.
- **Captions are placed rather than hung.** Every name on the map used to sit at a fixed
  offset from the thing it named, with no second answer when that spot was occupied: a
  block caption was dropped and a zone caption was drawn through whatever stood there. A
  name now tries three rings of positions around its block and takes the first that is
  clear, with a hairline back to the block for anything placed past the first ring
  ([ADR 23](docs/adr/0023-a-caption-is-placed-not-hung.md)). Every drawn building is
  reserved, not just the productive ones — the map draws storage, the HUB and the Space
  Elevator as solid shapes too — and zone names go through the same search, hugging their
  box's top-left corner and walking round it when a building is standing there. On the
  reference save's opening view that took 12 block captions to 15 and 7 crowded zone
  captions to 7 clear ones: 22 names, none overlapping anything.
- **Why a line is slow, not just how slow.** `WorldSnapshot` now carries what is waiting
  in each machine's input buffer, what has piled up in its output buffer, a generator's
  remaining fuel, and the total sitting in every container. Bottlenecks read the two
  buffers and name the cause — the ingredient that ran out, measured in runs so a recipe
  wanting 25 screws and one wanting 2 wire can be compared at all, or the product that has
  nowhere to go ([ADR 24](docs/adr/0024-the-buffers-say-why.md)). The same sentence appears
  on the map's hover card.
- **Space Elevator parts built but never delivered** are named under the delivery meters —
  34 Smart Plating in a container against 0 delivered reads as "nothing made yet" without
  it.
- **Generators standing empty** are counted beside the power draw, so a coal plant
  averaging 79% resolves to the one burner that has run out.
- **Power grids.** `WorldSnapshot` carries every `FGPowerCircuit` with what it draws and
  what it can supply, and each placement knows which grid it is on. Satisfactory does not
  blend power, so a base can have one grid browning out while another idles
  ([ADR 25](docs/adr/0025-a-grid-is-checked-before-a-buffer.md)). Overview shows drawn
  against built, per grid, and a line whose grid cannot meet its own demand is reported as
  **unpowered** — checked before the buffers, because a machine whose grid has died has a
  full input and an empty output and would otherwise read as starving.

- **The plan writes itself.** The Planner opened on an empty box and asked what you wanted
  the factory to make, and after five days nobody had answered it. It now leads with what
  the Space Elevator is waiting for, read from the save: what is still to make once
  deliveries and what is already boxed are taken off, and what the factory produces of each
  part today. One button turns it into targets
  ([ADR 26](docs/adr/0026-the-plan-writes-itself.md)). On the reference save that is 466
  Smart Plating, 500 Versatile Framework and 100 Automated Wiring — 5 : 5 : 1 per minute,
  landing together in about 1h 40m, and 21 machines still to build.

- **History is seeded from the autosaves already on disk.** The game keeps three rotating
  slots plus whatever you saved by hand, which is a time series nobody was reading; the
  sync script now reads the rest of the session and the board records them on load. What is
  shipped is a trimmed snapshot rather than a digest, so the rule about what a point
  contains stays in one place — 12 KB for four saves, against roughly 230 KB sent whole.

- **What is in the warehouse, and who is waiting for it.** Overview lists what stands in
  containers, biggest first, and names the line that wants each pile. A line starving on an
  item the base already holds a run of is told so outright — _"1,000 sitting in a container
  — this is routing, not production"_ — because "build more" is the wrong instruction when
  the belt simply goes somewhere else. On the reference save three of the five starving
  lines are in exactly that position: Cable waiting on Wire with 2,029 in a box, Rotor on
  Screws with 1,000, Smart Plating on Rotor with 63.

- **The plan, standing on the ground.** Machines the plan calls for that are not built yet
  are drawn on the map as dashed outlines, at their real footprint and facing the way their
  neighbours face, on ground that is actually free
  ([ADR 27](docs/adr/0027-the-plan-stands-on-the-ground.md)). They go in the cell that
  already makes the thing, or the one the target was pinned to; a recipe nothing in the base
  makes yet is reported rather than dropped on the nearest patch of grass. Never filled and
  never coloured by uptime — a machine that does not exist has no health to report. The
  toolbar gains `Plan · N` when there is a plan to show.

- **Compare any two saves, not just the last two.** History gains a from/with picker over
  the session's recorded saves, labelled by play time and file name, defaulting to the last
  two as before. Choosing a session already worked; choosing the moment did not, so "what
  changed in the last hour" had no way to be asked.

- **The Planner plans against the real factory.** A line card whose plan says "+3 more"
  now checks that against what the world is doing, and says so when the two disagree:
  _"Not the constraint — output full, 399 Iron Rod waiting, 5,178 more in storage. More
  machines here would make the pile bigger."_ The solver works from rates and cannot know
  that; the board can, and used to contradict its own bottleneck list instead.
- **What the warehouse already covers.** Inputs & surplus leads with the stock the plan can
  eat, as _time_ rather than a rate — a plan is a rate and a stock is a quantity, and
  dividing one by the other is the honest comparison. On the reference save that is 2h 15m
  of Cable, 53 min of Iron Rod and 42 min of Wire already made.

- **The flow is drawn against the world.** Every step now says how much of itself is
  standing — `4 / 6 Smelter · 2 to build` — and carries the real uptime as a bar, so the
  picture answers "what is left to build, and what is already struggling" in one look. A step
  nothing has been built for is **dashed**, the same language the map uses for a planned
  machine that is not there. Rates are written on the edges rather than hidden behind a
  hover, cased so a label crossing three belts stays readable. Clicking a step lights its
  chain and fogs the rest — the same gesture, and the same answer, as clicking a machine on
  the map.

- **Will the lights stay on.** The Planner says what the factory will draw once the plan is
  built, against what the generators standing can supply — and **per grid**, because
  Satisfactory does not blend circuits and a base can sit at 70% overall with one grid over
  its own limit. Only the machines still to build are charged, since the rest are already
  drawing and already counted. New machines go on the grid their recipe already runs on, and
  on the largest grid where nothing runs it yet. On the reference save: 188 MW now, +231 MW
  from 24 machines, 419 MW of 550 MW built, with all of it landing on grid 0 at 397 / 490.

- **The board runs with no game and no save.** ADR 3 keeps the extracted database out of
  the repository, which is right about the licence and had a cost: without Satisfactory
  installed, `npm run dev` stopped at _"No game database found"_ and the app
  could not be looked at at all. It now falls back to a demo — a hand-written slice of the
  early game (`packages/game-data/src/demo.ts`, fifteen items and eleven recipes,
  typed out rather than extracted) and a fictional base built to be interesting rather than
  merely valid: a line starving on something 900 of which sit in a container, one backed up
  with 2,400 stored, a second power grid with no generation on it, a line the game has not
  measured yet, and a Space Elevator part built but never delivered. A banner says so
  permanently, because numbers about a base that does not exist look exactly like numbers
  about one that does.

- **What to build first.** "21 still to build" is a number, not a plan. The missing
  machines are now ordered by what they unblock: a step can be built today when everything
  its recipe eats is either raw or already coming off a machine that exists, and everything
  else says what it is waiting for. On the reference save that puts Steel Ingot first —
  it unblocks five other steps — and holds back the five that would stand idle without it.
  Deliberately not a schedule: no time estimates, no critical path, only the difference
  between a machine that will run when you build it and one that will not
  ([ADR 28](docs/adr/0028-the-planner-plans-against-the-world.md)).

- **A Demo button in the header**, so the demo is reachable without uninstalling the game.
  It swaps the base in memory rather than on disk — your own save is one click back, under
  a button that says so — and it works on a built export, where there is no script to run.
  `npm run demo` is still there for the other case: it exercises the whole no-install
  fallback, database included, which the button does not.

- The map legend explains **power lines**, which it has drawn since it was first drawn and
  never named.

### Fixed

- **The extractor's main-thread fallback imported the worker module**, whose top level set
  `self.onmessage` — on the main thread, the window's — so any message to the page echoed
  back to itself forever, and a cross-origin opener could drive extractions in the
  visitor's tab. The extraction is a plain function in `lib/extract-docs.ts` now; the
  worker imports it and nothing imports the worker.
- **`snapshot.modded` was always false**: the save header stores the flag as an Int32 and
  the reader compared it to `true`. Found by the adversarial review, not the test, which
  had used a boolean fixture.
- **A dropped file navigated the tab away** unless it landed on the drop zone, which is not
  on screen once a save is loaded — every first visit, on a hosted copy. The window is the
  drop target now (`DropAnywhere`), with an overlay while dragging, and the e2e suite drops
  a real file on the body.
- A slow restore from IndexedDB could revert a recipe book dropped moments earlier, and a
  Forget during an extraction was undone when it finished: a generation counter on the
  provider makes every result answer to the last user action.
- One Worker per job, terminated after it, for both saves and books. A worker script that
  failed to load or was killed by the browser used to leave the shared slot stuck for the
  life of the tab, with every later book routed to the main thread.
- The earlier saves of a multi-file drop were digested against the recipe book of the
  moment they were parsed and never again. They travel with the board now and are
  re-digested like the snapshot on screen when a book changes.
- History's burn-down clamped a delivery past the quota to 100% while Progression withdrew
  the quota; both go through `quotaFor` now.
- Refusals for absurd sizes (a 250 MB save, a 100 MB recipe book), a prefilled bug report
  that fits in a URL, a note when the book could not be remembered, a readable name for
  lines the book does not know, and a way back to a dropped save after viewing the demo.
- The view strip scrolls sideways on a phone instead of pushing the page wider.
- The e2e static server stays inside the export, answers a malformed URL with 400 instead
  of exiting, binds to localhost, and serves a Windows export's mis-named segment files.
- The map's scene data did not list `ghosts` and `showPlan` as dependencies, so hiding the
  plan left the ghosts drawn; and the scene effect read the selected zone directly, which
  would have rebuilt the scene on every click had it been listed. Found by the new lint
  rule; the selection now goes through a ref.

- **Foundations were never drawn first.** The floor is sorted to the back of the scene by
  matching a building against `Foundation|Wall|Ramp|…`, and it was matched against the
  building's _detail_ — a recipe's machine, or a miner's ore, which is empty for every
  foundation there has ever been. It tests the name now.
- **The Planner's node estimate was invented.** The raw-input table printed a "Mk.1 miners"
  column computed as `rate / 60` — a hardcoded normal-purity Miner Mk.1, which tells someone
  with three Mk.3s nothing and never mentioned what was standing in their own save. It reads
  `2 standing · 120 /min (60–240)` now: the mine that is there, and the purity as the range
  it is.
- **The demo base was burning coal in its Biomass Burners**, which no burner will take.
  Nothing read a generator's fuel until the database learned what fuel costs, and then the
  demo was quoting a rate for something that cannot happen. They burn Solid Biofuel.
- **The demo's hand-typed indices had gone stale, in two places.** Grid 0 listed the first
  ten buildings and none of its own burners, so a board pricing what a grid burns found no
  generators on the only grid that has any; and seven of the ten belt links pointed at
  whatever had drifted into that index — `20 → 0` was written as _iron miner into the first
  smelter_ and had become _the Smart Plating assembler into it_, which the map drew. Both
  are worked out from the placements now, and a test pins that every link joins buildings
  that could be joined and every grid member says it is on that grid.
- **The demo claimed 90 MW off three burners with one of them empty**, which is a state
  the game cannot be in: a save reports what its generators can supply now. It has four
  burners, three of them burning, and the fourth is what "30 MW idle" points at.
- The demo banner no longer says no Satisfactory install was found when one was. It sat
  directly beside a button offering to go back to the real save it said could not be
  found; with a database from the reader's own install it now says so.
- The demo base has power lines and a wired second grid. It carried a power _story_ — one
  circuit comfortable, one with no generation on it — and nothing on the map to show it,
  because poles are drawn as wiring rather than as buildings and no wiring existed.
- Switching to the demo and back could get stuck. The header treated "the baked-in save
  happens to be the demo" and "the reader asked for the demo" as one thing, so on a machine
  with no game the Demo button vanished and "Your save" restored the demo again. They are
  separate now, and the demo is resolved once at load so a button is never offered for a
  snapshot that failed to parse.
- The Infrastructure panel names buildings from the database instead of splitting the class
  name itself: 'Biomass Burner' and 'The HUB', not 'Generator Biomass_Automated' and
  'Trading Post'. It has its own humanising fallback for anything the game ships unnamed,
  which is why the local one was never missed.
- **CI is green again, and had not been for some time.** `describe.skipIf` skips the
  tests it guards and still runs the factory that declares them, so the integration suite’s
  `readFileSync` threw ENOENT at collection on any machine without the game — every CI
  run, quietly, for as long as the file has existed. The read happens outside the block now.
- The app’s typecheck syncs the _save_ as well as the database. It imports both statically,
  so a missing snapshot fails `tsc` exactly as a missing database does; this only
  surfaced once the check stopped skipping itself in CI.
- Plan ghosts on the map name themselves. They were dashed rectangles with no caption and
  no legend key, which is not a map but a puzzle: the first person to see one asked what
  the weird empty boxes were. They now carry the same block captions every other machine
  does, in the accent colour and suffixed "· to build", and are blocked separately from
  real machines so a ghost never merges into a block of built ones and names neither.
- The Planner's "still to build" is counted per line. It was the plan's total machines
  minus every machine standing in the world, which credited the ones the plan never asked
  for — a Solid Biofuel and a Concrete constructor made the reference save read 21 when it
  was 24, and disagreed with the power panel directly below it.
- `allSaves` no longer returns null when the saves folder does not exist, which
  crashed the sync script for anyone who has never played — exactly the person the demo is
  for.
- **A plan now survives a page load.** `BoardProvider` restored from `localStorage` in one
  effect and persisted in two others, all on the same mount — and the restore is a dispatch,
  so it did not take effect until the next render while the writers ran immediately with the
  initial empty state, straight over what had just been read. Set targets, reload, and they
  were gone. Every observation this project made about the Planner going unused was taken
  through that bug.
- History no longer opens with one point in it. It recorded only what passed through the
  page, so on a fresh browser every chart said "one save so far — the line starts at two"
  until the tab had been left open beside the game for an hour. The reference save now
  opens on four points across thirteen minutes of play.
- The Phase 1 and Phase 2 presets are gone. They were fixed lists and could not know what
  had been delivered, so they proposed the same 5 : 5 : 1 whether you had built none of the
  phase or all but the last twenty; the proposal above the editor is read from the save
  instead, and a save-blind duplicate beside it would only have disagreed.
- Power draw is read from the save rather than totalled from the database. Totalling
  nominal draw per production line misses everything without a recipe — miners, pumps, the
  radar tower — and on the reference save reported 125 MW against a real 188 MW, with no
  sense of the 550 MW built.
- Bottleneck lines are no longer all labelled "starving". Uptime has at least two causes
  that want opposite fixes, and the label was picked from the number alone: on the
  reference save the two largest lines — Iron Rod at 67% and Iron Ingot at 83% — had full
  input buffers _and_ full output buffers, so they were backed up, and the advice the
  label implied would have made them worse.

- Solver no longer manufactures raw ore through late-game Converter recipes. It answered a
  Tier 2 request with 22 Converters and 733 SAM/min before this.
  ([ADR 0004](docs/adr/0004-raw-resources-terminate-the-solve.md))
- Extractor no longer drops variable-power machines. The Converter, Particle Accelerator
  and Quantum Encoder leave `mPowerConsumption` at zero and declare an estimated range
  instead, so every recipe they make was being discarded.
- Extractor no longer drops ammo recipes. Those item descriptors live under native classes
  that do not contain the word "Descriptor".
- Zod schema no longer silently strips `powerRangeMW`. Added a compile-time
  key-completeness check in both directions so a schema can't omit a domain field again.
- Building ids in `WorldSnapshot` now match machine ids in `GameDatabase`; the `Build_`
  prefix was only being stripped on one of the two paths.
- The base map is drawn from belt and power routes rather than a dot per building. The
  first version was an unreadable star field: no structure, no names, four identical
  "Iron Ingot" labels. Machines running the same recipe now merge into one mark with a
  count, labels try four positions and are dropped rather than stacked, and buildings
  the game ships without a display name fall back to a humanised class name.
- Progression no longer reports more milestones researched than exist. It counted every
  purchased schematic — tutorials and customiser unlocks included — against a
  denominator of numbered milestones only.
- Uptime values are no longer printed in their status colour. Contrast for the warning
  step falls below the 4.5:1 text threshold in light mode; the bar carries the state
  and the number stays in text ink.
- The map no longer crops buildings that anchor no zone. It framed the zones, and zones
  are anchored on machines with a recipe — so one of four coal generators, six metres
  past the edge of the last one, was counted in the legend and drawn nowhere. The frame
  is now grown from everything the map draws
  ([ADR 10](docs/adr/0010-the-frame-reaches-for-its-content.md)), and what is still out
  of reach gets a labelled pointer at the edge instead of a silent crop.
- Belt direction chevrons no longer all stack on the origin. `transform` is a Chakra
  style prop, so an SVG transform list passed to a chakra element is read as CSS, found
  invalid, and dropped. Positioning moved to a plain `<g>` wrapper.
- Clicking a zone works. The map took pointer capture on `pointerdown`, which retargets
  the `pointerup` and moves the resulting `click` to the common ancestor — so the map
  swallowed every click meant for a zone. Capture is now taken on the first drag
  movement.
- Belts that pass through the view no longer vanish when both their ends leave it. Route
  points were filtered against the frame, which dropped the crossing segment; routes are
  now drawn whole and clipped.
- The snapshot's Zod schema no longer strips fields it has not been told about. It knew
  nothing of what a placement was for, so the board drew a base with no miners, no
  generators and no coal plant out of a file that had all three — the same class of bug as
  `powerRangeMW`, and it now carries the same compile-time key-completeness check.
- `humanise` produces "Miner Mk.1" rather than "Miner Mk1". Its regex had been written
  with escape sequences that were interpreted before they reached the file, leaving two
  literal backspace bytes around a pattern that matched "Mkd".
- The map opens at the size it fits to. The surface was measured inside the init effect,
  before the browser had laid it out, so the first fit ran against the fallback width and
  the real one arrived too late to move the camera — the Base view opened at 161% of
  itself with the copper wing off the edge, and only Reset ever showed what it meant to
  show.
- `/base?zone=coal-power` flies to the zone rather than only selecting it. The effect that
  moves the camera bailed out while the surface had no measured size, which on arrival it
  never has, and nothing re-ran once it did.
- The zoom readout follows the camera when it flies to a zone. It only ever tracked the
  buttons and the wheel, so focusing a zone left it reading 100% at eight times that.
- Outposts are reachable. Panning was bounded by the opening frame plus a screen of
  slack, and the opening frame deliberately refuses to include the far-flung, so at 900%
  the coal outpost could not be reached by dragging, by flying to its zone, or at all —
  the camera pinned against the edge of the factory and drew empty ground. The frame is
  bought with buildings; the leash is now everything drawn.
- The scale bar and the zoom readout can no longer disagree. Both are derived from one
  piece of state rather than the readout from state and the bar from a ref the render
  had not seen move.
- The demo base no longer runs recipes its own save says are locked. It made Rotors and
  Reinforced Iron Plates while owning neither of the schematics that grant them — nobody
  could see it until the board learned to read unlocks, and it would have made the board's
  newest answer look broken on the first page anyone without the game opens. A test now
  pins it.
