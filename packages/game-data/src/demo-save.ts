/**
 * A base that does not exist, so the board has one to talk about.
 *
 * `demo.ts` gets the app past "no game database"; this gets it past "no save".
 * Between them anyone can clone the repository and see the whole thing working
 * without owning Satisfactory — which is what the repository being shareable
 * actually means.
 *
 * Written to be *interesting*, not merely valid. A base where everything runs
 * at 100% demonstrates nothing, so this one has the two failures the board
 * exists to tell apart:
 *
 * - **Cable is starving.** Two wire in its input buffer, and 900 more sitting
 *   in a container — the belt goes to the wrong place, which is a routing
 *   problem wearing a supply problem's clothes.
 * - **Iron Rod is backed up.** Full input, full output, 2,400 already stored.
 *   The instruction "build more" is wrong here and the board says so.
 *
 * Plus a second power grid with no generation on it, one line the game has not
 * measured yet, and a Space Elevator part built but never delivered.
 *
 * The shape is `WorldSnapshot`, but this package cannot say so: `save-reader`
 * depends on `game-data`, and importing the type back would close a cycle. It
 * is validated at the app's boundary by the same Zod schema every real snapshot
 * goes through, which is the check that matters.
